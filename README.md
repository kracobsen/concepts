### Notes
* Since this is a time limited task, I only added very basic tests and error handling, tests are also integrated in the single project, which is not best practice.
* Integration tests hit the real API, in real life I would mock this out given time
* I found an API endpoint that allowed to retrieve a single concept that was not described in the task, I assumed this would be okay.
